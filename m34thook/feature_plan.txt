Remapping other keys to ~ via our idInputEventQueue_QueueEvent hook so people without that key can use the console easily/prevent accidental opening of the console
Filtering out certain classes from raycast hits for mh_grab, things like triggers, lights, lightprobes.
Ability to grab multiple entities (often related entities are all placed at the same position, mh_grab grabs all at the same pos)
flesh out more of the netmessage code 
add scripting that can access the engine via all the shit we already have set up here, probably luajit since its lightweight and very fast. I do hate lua though
Override filesystem scan thread, reuse stuff from my fast NtQueryDirectoryFile based file searcher. Automatically reloads decls when changes are detected

Try to introduce "safe" decl reloading. This may not work, but basically the idea is to create a fiber that sets up SEH in case of some kind of segfault and executes reload_decl. Our overrides for idfatalerror will have some new code added to
check whether a setjmp handler is set up for this context and then jmps to that, passing the error message along so that we can show it to the user. The fiber will then switch back to the main thread and be deleted.


Swap out idEncounterManager::Handle_Event's vtbl entry in order to implement enemy randomization



Hook/replace methods on useless entity types' vtbls in order to add in new entity types for custom game logic

classinformer regex for this: ^([^\s]+)\s+598\s+([^\s]+)([^\r]+)

idVolume_OliviasGuardFight_DangerZone is probably unused, same for jakesDevWidget


to call idBloatedEntity, grab idBloatedEntity typeinfo and then call PlacementCreateInstance((obj), sizeof(idBloatedEntity))

replace idProject_SiphonGrenade with mh_scripted_projectile
replace idStaticCannon with mh_scripted_weapon


Add new events?
	Replace existing ones that might be unused.
	Potentially unused events:
		testFunctionality //no xrefs to eventdef other than ctor
		isProdBuilding

	these do absolutely nothing in idEntity::Base:
	         case EVID_fadeSound: //no xrefs to its eventdef other than ctor

            case EVID_fadePitch://no xrefs to its eventdef other than ctor
            case EVID_midnightStarted:
            case EVID_midnightInterrupted:
            case EVID_midnightFinished:
            case EVID_midnightSkipped:
            case EVID_midnightFailed:
